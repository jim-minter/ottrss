Medium
- Go back twice when no articles to display any more
- Prevent multiple accounts being added (have auth.Activity use SettingsFragment)

Low
- Investigate OpenShift EOFException?

Would like to have
- Play videos (javascript etc.)
- Mark all read button on articles view
- Separate list of all starred / unread articles
- Option to load article in browser
- Cache linked pages
- always sync @ 06:00am
- use content provider rather than broadcast listeners
- open article in browser option
- smaller arrows

- Activity updates when syncing
  - handle article delete while in webview
  - handle feed going away
  - check through how many refreshes on update

- Keep #favourites configurable & logic

- Settings page
  - select feeds (low priority) & set feed settings without having to happen to download the feed first
  - add feed (low priority)

Performance
- Improve article list show performance (provider model, or at least multi-threaded)
- Improve sync performance
- Sync memory usage
